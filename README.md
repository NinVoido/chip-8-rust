This is my attempt at writing a CHIP-8 emulator on Rust. Currently this is WIP; I will do my best to change that. Goals:
1)Implement all instructions of original CHIP-8
2)Create a load and debug menus using egui
3)Have a working CHIP-8 emulator:)
22/36 instructions are implemented yet. Mostly features that depend on external features are todo for now;
