Yes, this is another CHIP-8 emulator written in Rust. Goals:
1) Implement all CHIP-8 instructions  and architecture☑️
2) Make a debug GUI☑️
3) Implement all SCHIP-48 instructions and architecture WIP
Some screenshots of the emulator:

In the future I might implement XO-CHIP instructions and definitely want to rework some elements of GUI. The project is being actively developed, so follow for updates!
